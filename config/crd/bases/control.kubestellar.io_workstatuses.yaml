                  `lastCurrencyUpdateTime` is the time of the latest update to either

                  the time when the core became informed of the update.
                  Before the first such update, this holds `time.Unix(0, 0)`

                  `lastGeneration` is that last `ObjectMeta.Generation` from the WDS that
                  propagated to the WEC. This is not to imply that it was successfully applied there;
                  for that, see `lastGenerationIsApplied`.
                  Zero means that none has yet propagated there.
